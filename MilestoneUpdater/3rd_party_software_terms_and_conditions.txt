I do not guarantee that it is correct, so use it at your own risk.  If you use

It would also be nice if my name and URL were left in the comments.  But none

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Attribution 2.0 England and Wales

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL 
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. 
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, 
AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

Licence

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING 
ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE 
TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN 
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

This Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence enables You (all 
capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and 
distribute Works worldwide, provided that You credit the Original Author.

'The Licensor' [one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering 
the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence]

and

'You'

agree as follows:

1. Definitions

"Attribution" means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and 
have rights in the Work, Derivative Work or Collective Work under this Licence.
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along 
with a number of other separate and independent works, assembled into a 
collective whole.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, 
adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that 
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for 
the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a 
musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in 
timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Licence" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence 
agreement.
"Original Author" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms 
of this Licence.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, 
words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Licence Terms

2.1 The Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive, Licence for use and for the duration of copyright in the Work.

You may:

copy the Work;
create one or more Derivative Works;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
copy Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work; and
publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, 
Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work, to the 
public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter 
created.
HOWEVER,

You must not:

impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Derivative Work or 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alter or restrict the 
terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or 
intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Derivative 
Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alters or 
restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the 
effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
sublicense the Work;
subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright, 
Designs and Patents Act 1988.
FINALLY,

You must:

make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken 
word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and 
Derivative Works and Collective Works published, distributed, performed or 
otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You;
recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of attribution in any 
Work, Derivative Work and Collective Work that You publish, distribute, 
perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the 
Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to 
this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to 
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright 
notice or licensing information for the Work.
Additional Provisions for third parties making use of the Work

2.2. Further licence from the Licensor

Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate

the Work; or
any Derivative Work; or
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work
the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the 
Work (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on 
the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.

2.3. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any 
applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally 
recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.

2.4. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, 
including but not limited to, the exclusive right to collect, whether 
individually or via a licensing body, such as a collecting society, royalties 
for any use of the Work.

3. Warranties and Disclaimer

Except as required by law, the Work or any Derivative Work is licensed by the 
Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of 
any kind, either express or implied.

4. Limit of Liability

Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the 
Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for 
loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.

5. Termination

The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically 
upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities 
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this 
Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such 
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences.

6. General

6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement 
is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or 
unenforceable.

6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the 
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, 
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. 
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear 
in any communication in any form.

6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under 
the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.

6.4. This Licence shall be governed by the law of England and Wales and the 
parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of 
England and Wales.

7. On the role of Creative Commons

7.1. Neither the Licensor nor the User may use the Creative Commons logo 
except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons 
Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons 
trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade 
mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be 
otherwise available upon request from time to time.

7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role 
in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor 
or user of the Licence.

7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the 
Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by 
all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for 
the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting 
to use or using this Licence.

7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes 
no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the 
Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting 
from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.

7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE 
CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE 
COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM 
THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty 
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable 
to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including 
without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages 
arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) 
sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the 
Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is 
licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative 
Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the 
prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in 
compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as 
may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from 
time to time.

Creative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.

Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents) 
"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project. 
Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of this implementation of VP8, where such license applies only 
to those patent claims, both currently owned by Google and acquired in the future, 
licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this implementation of VP8. 
This grant does not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of this implementation. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee 
institute or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation
of VP8 or any code incorporated within this implementation of VP8 constitutes direct or 
contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent 
rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate 
as of the date such litigation is filed.

- This application uses SQLite which has been dedicated to
- the public domain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: https://sqlite.org/copyright.html

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, 
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for
example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other
open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final
deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those
scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the
SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code
has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
